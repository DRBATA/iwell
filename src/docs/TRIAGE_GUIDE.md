# Triage Guide

## Important Note
The triage patterns shown here represent clear, black-and-white decisions for basic guidance only. The actual app experience will be:

1. **Personalized**
   - Adapts to your health history
   - Considers your specific symptoms
   - Takes into account your preferences

2. **More Detailed**
   - Highly targeted symptom control
   - Comprehensive diagnostic tools (coming soon)
   - Integration with BP monitoring and cognitive tracking

3. **Work in Progress**
   - Currently focusing on BP monitoring and cognitive tracking
   - Full diagnostic capabilities to be added later
   - Continuous improvements based on user feedback

## Current Implementation

The triage system provides basic guidance for:
- Joint pain and injuries
- Mental health concerns
- General symptoms

All recommendations default to "Contact your GP" for safety, while the app builds out more sophisticated diagnostic capabilities.

## Future Development

The diagnostic system will expand to include:
1. Integration with BP data
2. Connection to cognitive tracking
3. More sophisticated symptom analysis
4. Personalized recommendations

## Safety First

Remember:
- These are guidelines only
- When in doubt, contact your GP
- Call emergency services for serious concerns
- The app is a tool to help, not replace medical advice
